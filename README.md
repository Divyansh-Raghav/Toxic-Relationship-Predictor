# 💔 Toxic Relationship Predictor

This is a simple and fun project I built to **learn and practice React and Tailwind CSS**.  
It’s a mini quiz app that tries to "predict" the toxicity of a relationship based on a few questions.  
Of course, it’s not a real psychological tool — it’s just made for **learning and fun**.

- To understand the **fundamentals of React**  
- To get hands-on experience with **Tailwind CSS**  
- To explore how simple UIs work, how **state is managed**, and how to **dynamically render results** in React

## 🧠 Concepts I Practiced

### ✅ React Concepts:

- `useState` for managing state (current question, answers, result)
- Conditional rendering (`if`, `?:`, `&&`) to switch between question and result views
- Component-based design (used a `QuestionCard` component)
- Passing props to components (question text, selected option, handler functions)
- Arrays and mapping to display options

### 🎨 Tailwind CSS Concepts:

- Utility-first styling (e.g., `bg-red-100`, `rounded-lg`, `text-center`, etc.)
- Responsive layout with `flex`, `justify-between`, `items-center`
- Dynamic styling using className based on state (e.g., changing background colors)
- Button styling with hover and disabled states
